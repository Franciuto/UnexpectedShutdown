# UnexpectedShutdown
A simple program to control someone's computer with a telegram bot

To start using this program there are some things you have to do:

1. Open the UnexpectedShutdown.py and replace the `BotToken` with your personal token created by using <a href="https://telegram.me/BotFather">BotFather</a> on Telegram
2. In the same file also replace the `TGID` with your Telegram id (You can find it chatting with <a href="https://telegram.me/userinfobot">userinfobot</a> )
3. Send a message to your bot to initialize the conversation
4. When you run the file, if you did everything right, you will receive a notification by the bot.

I'am a 14 years old boy and this is my first program made with python, i hope you will enjoy.
Let me know if you have some changes or reviews to do at the program to make it better.
